In this project builds a denoising autoencoder using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
It adds Gaussian noise to input images and trains a deep neural network to reconstruct the original images.
The autoencoder consists of stacked dense layers for both encoding and decoding to improve reconstruction quality.
Results are visualized by comparing original, noisy, and denoised images, demonstrating effective noise removal.
Training progress is shown with plots of loss and accuracy across epochs.
